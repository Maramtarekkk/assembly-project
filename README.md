In game assembly language, Tic Tac Toe (XO) can be implemented by defining the game board,
handling player input, checking for win conditions, and updating the display. 
It involves low-level operations like memory manipulation and conditional branching to create a functional game loop.
Each cell of the game board is typically represented by a memory location, and player moves are processed based on user input.
Win conditions are checked by examining rows, columns, and diagonals. The assembly code must efficiently manage the game state and provide a responsive user interface.
